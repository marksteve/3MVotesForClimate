  <h1>#3MVotesForClimate</h1>
  <article>
    <p class="emphasis">As the window for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees continues to shrink, we stand at the
      doorstep of the
      “decisive decade of action” on climate. <strong>The leaders we elect in the May 2022 Philippine national elections
        will determine our climate future not only for the next six years, but for generations to come.</strong></p>
    <p class="inset">OurEnergy2030, a youth-based bipartisan coalition calling for decisive, coherent, and complete
      energy
      transformation and climate action within this decade, aims to mobilize 3 million youth voters to #VoteforClimate
      in
      May 2022, the first national elections since the pandemic.</p>
    <p>The May 2022 national elections will see at least 4 million first-time voters, most of whom are increasingly
      climate-aware youth. This number — about 10% of total votes cast in 2016— is significant, meaning climate policy
      and
      ambitious renewable energy plans could be decisive in the election’s outcome.</p>
    <p>Stay tuned for the campaign’s official launch on 12 – 12 – 12. (December 12, 2021 at 12:00 NN). In the meantime,
